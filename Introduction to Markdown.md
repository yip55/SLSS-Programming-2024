**Hello** _world_.

This is **_markdown_**.

[ChartGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://www.google.com) to find things.

# Table in Markdown

## this is a level two header
Name   |   age   | superpower |  coolness
---    | ---     | ---        |----
Batman | 37      |  none      | VERY
Mr. Ubial| pretty old | he can nap anywhere | not really

to make a list we can use the following:

* this is item one 
* this is item two  
    * this is a subpoint in the list 
        * this is also a subpoint 

- this is another list 
- we can us dashes instead of *s

1. this is item one 
2. this is item two 
    * This is a **subpoint** under item two
4. this is _item_ three

# Blockquote

these are usually useful to give emphasis to a collection of lines
